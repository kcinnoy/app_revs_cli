# AppRevsCli

Welcome to the AppRevs CLI Gem. This Gem allows the user to discover business apps that may be useful for their business. The user selects the category they are interested in and then is shown the top 5 ranked options. The user then has the option to view the remaining apps that were outside the top 5 ranked.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'app_revs_cli'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install app_revs_cli

## Usage

Type ruby bin/app_revs_cli into your terminal and follow the prompts displayed.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
